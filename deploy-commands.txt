# Commands to apply updated configuration
kubectl apply -f jobportal-ingress.yaml

# Check if ingress was created properly
kubectl get ingress jobportal-ingress -o yaml

# Get the external IP of your ingress controller (needed for DNS configuration)
kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx

# Once you have the external IP, update your domain DNS A record to point to this IP
# This is typically done through your domain registrar's website

# After DNS propagation (which can take up to 24-48 hours), check that your site is accessible
